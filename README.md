# DataPreProcess
Pre-processing both the #NowPlaying-RS as well as InCarMusic datasets so they can be used by the modified version of the CARSKit (https://github.com/boninggong/CARSKitModified) to create initial recommendation lists.

The #NowPlaying-RS dataset is left out in this repository because of its size. It can be downloaded from https://zenodo.org/record/3248543. The extracted files should be placed within _\data\nprs\\_ in order to use the pre-process scripts. WARNING: The original dataset contains millions of listening events, so executing the pre-process scripts takes several hours.
